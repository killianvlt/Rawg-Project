# Presentation of the project: Video game explorer

In this project, we are implementing an application that allows you to discover details about the different video games available. You can search for games using the search bar and access additional information by clicking on a selected game.

# Using the RAWG API

We have used the RAWG API to get the information about the video games. The use of this API is necessary for the use of our site. It provides us with data about the different games, such as their names, genres, platforms, etc.

# Technology

The project was developed using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. We also used tailwindcss for site formatting and fast for rapid development.

In summary, this project gives you the opportunity to discover information about video games using RAWG API and enjoy the quality of construction through React, tailwindcss and fast. So go ahead and explore the world of video games!
